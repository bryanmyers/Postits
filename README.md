Postits
=================
Postits was written in PHP with a MySQL back end. It uses Ajax to create an app-like experience and is a simple note board with post it notes. I took this all a step further by making the postits draggable and if they are piled up they will come to the front if clicked (usign jQuery). This project has not been refactored.
